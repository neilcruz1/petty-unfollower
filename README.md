# Petty Unfollower
- This is a brief Python script that uses the Instabot library that lets you see your nonfollowers in a command line interface. There are programs/apps that most likely and already accomplish this, but this is just a neat Python program that's cool to use. 
- Works with Python version 3.5+

# Libraries used:
